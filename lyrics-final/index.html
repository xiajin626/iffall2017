					<h3 id="singer">Taylor Alison Swift (December 13, 1989)</h3>
					<p>American singer-songwriter. One of the leading contemporary recording artists, she is known for narrative songs about her personal life, which have received widespread media coverage.Red is her fourth studio album released on October 22, 2012. The album title was inspired by the "semi-toxic relationships" that Swift experienced during the process of conceiving this album, which she described the emotions she felt as "red emotions" due to their intense and tumultuous nature. Red touches on Swift's signature themes of love and heartbreak, however, from a more mature perspective while exploring other themes such as fame and the pressure of being in the limelight.</p>

				<em>[Verse 1]</em>
				<br />
				Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
				<br />
				Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly
				<br />
				Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall
				<br />
				Like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all
			</p>
			<p>
				<em>[Chorus]</em>
				<section class="chorus">
					<br />
					Losing him was blue like I'd never known
					<br />
					Missing him was dark grey all alone
					<br />
					Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
					<br />
					But loving him was red
					<br />

				<em>[Verse 2]</em>
				<br />
				Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
				<br />
				Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
				<br />
				Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
				<br />
				Regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong
			</p>

				<em>[Chorus]</em>

					<br />
					Losing him was blue like I'd never known

					Missing him was dark grey all alone

					Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
					<br />
					But loving him was red
					<br />
					Oh, red

				<em>[Bridge]</em>
				<br />
				Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
				<br />
				Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
				<br />
				But moving on from him is impossible
				<br />
				When I still see it all in my head
				<br />
				In burning red
				<br />
				Burning, it was red
			</p>
			<P>
				<em>[Chorus]</em>
				<section class="chorus">
					<br />
					Oh, losing him was blue like I'd never known
					<br />
					Missing him was dark grey all alone
					<br />
					Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
					<br />
					Cause loving him was red
					<br />
					Yeah, yeah, red
					<br />

				<h3 class="red">We're burning red</h3>

				<em>[Post-Chorus]</em>
				<section class="chorus">
					<br />
					And that's why he's spinnin' 'round in my head
					<br />
					Comes back to me, burning red
					<br />
					Yeah, yeah
