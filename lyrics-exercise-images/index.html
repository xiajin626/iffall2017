				<em>[Verse 1:]</em>
				<br />
				Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
				<br />
				Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly
				<br />
				Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall
				<br />
				Like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all
			</p>
			<p>
				<em>[Chorus:]</em>
				<section class="chorus">
					<br />
					Losing him was <span />blue like I'd never known
					<br />
					Missing him was dark grey all alone
					<br />
					Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
					<br />
					But loving him was red
					<br />
				</section>
					<h3 class="red">Loving him was red</h3>
			</p>
			<p>
				<em>[Verse 2:]</em>
				<br />
				Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
				<br />
				Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
				<br />
				Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
				<br />
				Regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong
			</p>
			<p>
				<em>[Chorus:]</em>
				<section class="chorus">
					<br />
					Losing him was blue like I'd never known
					<br />
					Missing him was dark grey all alone
					<br />
					Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
					<br />
					But loving him was red
					<br />
					Oh, red
					<br />
				</section>
				<h3 class="red">Burning red</h3>
			</p>
			<p>
				<em>[Bridge:]</em>
				<br />
				Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
				<br />
				Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
				<br />
				But moving on from him is impossible
				<br />
				When I still see it all in my head
				<br />
				In burning red
				<br />
				Burning, it was red
			</p>
			<P>
				<em>[Chorus:]</em>
				<section class="chorus">
					<br />
					Oh, losing him was blue like I'd never known
					<br />
					Missing him was dark grey all alone
					<br />
					Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
					<br />
					Cause loving him was red
					<br />
					Yeah, yeah, red
					<br />
				</section>
				<h3 class="red">We're burning red</h3>
			</P>
			<p>
				<em>[Post-Chorus:]</em>
				<section class="chorus">
					<br />
					And that's why he's spinnin' 'round in my head
					<br />
					Comes back to me, burning red
					<br />
					Yeah, yeah
